\section{CIRCULAR ARRAY}
Common patterns for solving problems with circular arrays.

Normally, we should solve the linear problem and circular problem differently.

\subsection{Circular max sum}
Linear problem can be solved linear with simple algorithm, but the circular sum should use dp. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Construct left max sum for max sum over the $[0..i]$ (\textbf{forward} starting from the left side); construct right max sum for max sum over the indexes $[i..n-1]$ (\textbf{backward} starting from the right side). Notice that the max sum index ends AT or BEFORE i. 
\item The $maxSum = maxSum[i..n-1]+maxSum[0..i]$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Non-adjacent cell}
To solve circular non-adjacent array problem in linear way, we should consider 2 cases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Not consider the $A[1]$
\item Not consider the $A[-1]$ 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Binary search}
Searching for an element in a circular sorted array. Half of the array is sorted while the other half is not.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $A[0] < A[mid]$, then all values in the first half of the array are sorted.
\item If $A[mid] < A[-1]$, then all values in the second half of the array are sorted.
\item Then decide whether to got the \textbf{sorted half} or the \textbf{unsorted half}.
\end{enumerate}
