\chapter{Bit Manipulation}
\section{Concepts}
\subsection{Basics}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Bit value: bit0, bit1. 
\item BitSet/Bits
\item Bit position (bit interchangeably)
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Operations}
\rih{Mask.} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Masking to 1: to mask a single bit position, $bit \lor 1$
\item Masking to 0: to mask a single bit position, $bit \land 0$
\item Querying a bit position value: to query a single bit position, $bit \land 1$
\item Toggling bit values: to toggle a single bit position, $bit \oplus 1$
\end{enumerate}}
This can be extended to do masking operations on multiple bits. 
\rih{Rightmost bit set.} To get the rightmost bit, with the help of 2's complement:
$$
rightmost = bits \land -bits 
$$

\section{Single Number}
\subsection{Appear three times} 
Given an array of integers, every element appears three times except for one. Find that single one.

\rih{Using list.} Consider 4-bit numbers:
\begin{eqnarray*}
&& 0000 \\
&& 0001 \\
&& 0010 \\
&& ... \\
&& 1111
\end{eqnarray*}

Add (not $\land$) the bit values \textbf{vertically}, then result would be $abcd$ where $a, b, c, d$ can be any number, not just binary. $a, b, c, d$ can be divided by 3 if the all element appears three times. Until here, you can use a list to hold $a, b, c, d$. By mod 3, the single one that does not appear 3 times is found. 

To generalize to 32-bit \pythoninline{int}, use a list of length 32.

\rih{Using bits.}
To further optimize the space, use bits (bit set) instead of list. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Since all except one appears 3 times, we are only interested in $0, 1, 2$ (mod 3) count of bit1 appearances in a bit position.
\item We create 3 bit sets to represent $0, 1, 2$ appearances of all positions of bits.
\item For a bit, there is one and only one bit set containing bit1 in that bit position.
\item Transition among the 3 bit sets for every number:
$$
bitSet^{(i)} = (bitSet^{(i-1)} \land num) \lor (bitSet^{(i)} \land \lnot num)
$$
For $i$ appearances, the first part is the bit set \textbf{transited from} $(i-1)$ appearances, and the second part is the bit set \textbf{transited out} from itself. 
\end{itemize}}

\subsection{Two Numbers} 
Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

\begin{itemize}
\item Easily get: $x = a \oplus b$.
\item $a \neq b$; thus there are at least one 1-bit in $x$ is different.  
\item Take an arbitrary 1 bit set in $x$, and such bit set can classify the elements in the array into two separate groups.
\end{itemize}
