\chapter{Greedy}

\section{Introduction}
Philosophy: choose the best options at the current state without reverting the choice in the future. 

A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that follows the problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.

Greedy algorithm is a degenerated dp since the the past substructure is not remembered.

\subsection{Proof}
The proof technique for the correctness of the greedy method. 

Proof by contradiction, the solution of greedy algorithm is $\mat{G}$ and the optimal solution is $\mat{O}$, $\mat{O}\neq \mat{G}$ (or relaxed to $|\mat{O}|\neq |\mat{G}|$). 

Two general technique it is impossible to have $\mat{O}\neq \mat{G}$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Exchange method 
\item Stays-head mehod 
\end{enumerate}
