\section{Introduction}
\rih{Two-way range.} The current scanning node as the pivot, need to scan its left neighbors and right neighbors. 
$$
|\leftarrow p \rightarrow |
$$

If the relationship between the pivot and its neighbors is symmetric, since scanning range is $[i-k, i+k]$ and iterating from left to right, only consider $[i-k, i]$ to avoid duplication.
$$
|\leftarrow p
$$
